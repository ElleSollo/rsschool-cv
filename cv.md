## **About Me**
I am a journalist, but recently I decided to leave the profession. In December 2021, I started studying at RS School. Hopefully in the future I can become a front-end developer.

I would like to work in a team of like-minded people on interesting projects, create cool applications and websites. Most of all I am interested in projects related to writing and art.

**Personal qualities:**

quick learner, communicative, no bad habits.
## **Skills**
_I am just starting to learn, so I cannot boast of any particular skills in the field of programming._

I have little experience with __HTML__, __CSS__, __JavaScript__, __Git__.
## **Code Examples**
-------
```
const isLannisterSoldier = (color, shield) => {
  const result = (shield === 'lion' || color === 'red' && shield === null);
  return result;
};
console.log(isLannisterSoldier('red', 'lion'));
```
