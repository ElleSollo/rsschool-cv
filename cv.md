## **About Me**
I am a journalist, but recently I decided to leave the profession. In December 2021, I started studying at RS School. Hopefully in the future I can become a front-end developer.

I would like to work in a team of like-minded people on interesting projects, create cool applications and websites. Most of all I am interested in projects related to writing and art.

**Personal qualities:**

quick learner, communicative, no bad habits.
